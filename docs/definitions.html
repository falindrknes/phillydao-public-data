Bail
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>A set of pre-trial conditions placed upon the accused to allow them to be released from custody while awaiting trial. <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=00&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=1&amp;sctn=14&amp;subsctn=0">The purpose of the conditions are to ensure public safety</a>.</p>
Cash bail is a common condition that people receive (e.g. $10,000 bail). When a person is assigned cash bail, they may pay the Commonwealth some set amount of money to be released from custody while awaiting trial. When the accused successfully completes their trial without missing any appearances or otherwise violating their bail conditions, their money is returned. If they fail to meet their bail conditions, they may lose their bail money. When a person is given cash bail, they can often pay 10% of the full amount (also called “bond”), but will owe the full amount if they violate their bail conditions.

<p>A charge is an accusation by the Commonwealth that a person has committed a crime. Although a case often involves more than one charge, our <a href="Charge_Report.html">Charge Report</a> only looks at the most serious offense charged in each criminal case.</p>
In Philadelphia, the DAO, not the police, is responsible for deciding whether to charge an individual. Generally speaking, police investigate a case and present their investigation to the DAO. The DAO then determines whether there is enough evidence to file criminal charges and what charges should be filed. It is common that a person is charged with multiple offenses in a single criminal case. For example, Simple Assault is often charged at the same time as Recklessly Endangering Another Person.

<div class="dao-definition-title-word">
Diversion
</div>
<div class='dao-definition'>
<p>Diversion is a procedure by which the DAO removes cases from the usual path through the criminal justice process of incarceration and probation. Diversion allows the accused to participate in a Court approved program that, if completed successfully, will serve the needs of the Criminal Justice System. The programs are designed to be rehabilitative rather than punitive and the goal is to redirect individuals who have committed minor crime into a lifestyle that will keep them away from criminal involvement. Some of the benefits of diversionary programs are:</p></li>
<li>They allow the accused to quickly move out of the criminal justice system, bringing swift resolution of the case and reducing loads on overburdened courts</li>
<li>Many allow for the charges to be cleared from the accused’s record after successful program completion. This allows the individual to escape the lifetime burden of a criminal record in finding housing, employment, and other important life activities</li>
<li><p>Their tailored nature allows for targetting of specific programs for specific types of offenders (e.g. individuals with drug disuse disorders can seek rehabilitation) rather than just locking everyone up.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.phila.gov/districtattorney/diversion/Pages/default.aspx">common diversion programs in Philadelphia include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMP I and AMP II (Accellerated Misdemeanor Program)</li>
<li>Domestic Violence Diversion</li>
<li>Veteran’s Court</li>
<li>ARD (Accellerated Misdemeanor Program)</li>

First Judicial District (FJD)
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
The Pennsylvania court system is divided into “judicial districts.” The judicial district that operates in Philadelphia is called the First Judicial District (“FJD”). The Courts that comprise the FJD are the Municipal Court (which includes Traffic Court) and the Court of Common Pleas (which includes both the criminal and family courts). Because Philadelphia is large, the FJD covers just Philadelphia. Other Judicial Districts can cover more than one county.
</div>
<div class="dao-definition-title-word">
Future Years of Incarceration
</div>
<div class='dao-definition'>
All of the years of incarceration imposed on defendants in all cases that ended in a given time period. For example, a person could calculate all of the future years of incarceration for yesterday by adding up all of the carceral sentences imposed yesterday on all defendants in Philadelphia.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate future years of incarceration, we make a few assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We only track the jail/prison time that we assume a person will serve.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in the Philadelphia jails (sentences with a maximum of less than 2 years) will be released at their minimum sentence length.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in state prison (sentences with a maximum sentence of 2 years or more) will be released at 130% of their minimum sentence (e.g. a person with a 1-2 year sentence will be released in 1.3 years).</li>
<li>Consolidated sentences are treated as concurrent, not consecutive. When a person is sentenced in multiple cases on a single day, we assume that these cases have been consolidated and dealt with as a group. For the purpose of future years, we only look at the longest minimum and maximum sentences from that group of cases.</li>
<li>We only look at original sentences, not violations of parole or probation.</li>
</ol>
One of the goals of DA Larry Krasner’s policies is to reduce the number of years of future incarceration and future supervision. Overly long prison sentences and terms of parole and probation have cost millions in public dollars and have done nothing to improve public safety. In fact, research show that mass incarceration and over-supervision actually have a negative effect on the life of community. By making plea offers and sentencing recommendations below the low end of the Guidelines, DA Krasner has espoused a more reasonable sentencing policy. This will save millions of dollars that could be used to improve education, repair infrastructure and improve living conditions for all Philadelphians, while at the same time insuring that criminal behavior is punished appropriately.
</div>
<div class="dao-definition-title-word">
Future Years of Supervision
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>All of the years of supervision imposed on defendants in all cases that ended in a given time period. For example, a person could calculate all of the future years of supervision for yesterday by adding up all of the probation and parole sentences imposed yesterday on all defendants in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>To calculate future years of supervision, we make a few assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We only track the supervision time that a person will actually serve.<br />
</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in the Philadelphia jails (sentences with a maximum of less than 2 years) will be released at their minimum sentence length. The balance of their sentence (max - min) is counted as supervision.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in state prison (sentences with a maximum sentence of 2 years or more) will be released at 130% of their minimum sentence (e.g. a person with a 1-2 year sentence will be released in 1.3 years). The balance of their sentence (max - 1.3 x min) is counted as supervision.</li>
<li>Consolidated sentences are treated as concurrent, not consecutive. When a person is sentenced in multiple cases on a single day, we assume that these cases have been consolidated and dealt with as a group. For the purpose of future years, we only look at the longest minimum and maximum sentences from that group of cases.</li>
<li>We only look at original sentences, not violations of parole or probation.</li>
</ol>
One of the goals of DA Krasner’s policies is to reduce the number of years of Future Supervision. Research shows that, when a person is on parole or probation, and has served three years of that time without any violations ? any future supervision is superfluous. In making plea offers and sentencing recommendations, the DAO is very cognizant of this finding. Because of the requirements of Pennsylvania?s sentencing laws, it is not always possible to limit a parole following an incarcerative sentence to a reasonable amount of time, But to the extent possible, the DAO is attempting to convince judges to keep the time spent on parole and probation to reasonable lengths.

<div class='dao-definition'>
<p>Instead of going to trial, an accused person may choose to admit guilt and go directly to sentence. A guilty plea can be open or negotiated.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>negotiated</strong> plea is an agreement between the DAO and the accused on the charges that accused will admit guilt to, the charges that will be dropped, and the the sentence that will be recommended to the judge for the case. The agreement is sometimes called a plea bargain.</li>
<li>An <strong>open plea</strong> is one where the accused admits guilt and then the judge sets the sentence without a recommendation from the DAO.

Among other changes, overall arrests and cases charged have been lower than prior years and those arrests that have happened tend to be for more serious offenses.

<i class='fa fa-info-circle'></i>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the criminal legal system. Among other changes, overall arrests and cases charged have been lower than prior years and those arrests that have happened tend to be for more serious offenses.

<i class='fa fa-info-circle'></i>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the criminal legal system. Among other changes, overall arrests and cases charged have been lower than prior years and those arrests that have happened tend to be for more serious offenses. Because of this, statistics about arrests, cases charged, and bail should be interpreted with caution.

<i class='fa fa-info-circle'></i>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the criminal legal system. Among other changes, overall arrests and cases charged have been lower than prior years and those arrests that have happened tend to be for more serious offenses. Because of this, statistics about arrests, cases charged, and bail should be interpreted with caution.

<i class='fa fa-info-circle'></i>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the criminal legal system. Among other changes, overall arrests and cases charged have been lower than prior years and those arrests that have happened tend to be for more serious offenses.

<p>
<p>The DATA Lab at the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office (DAO) uses police, court, and other data streams to support a wide range of research on the criminal legal system. We work with external partners across all phases of the research arc to help develop impactful interventions, evaluations, and scholarship. This includes discussions around data sharing, data use agreements, and facilitating research involving Assistant District Attorneys (ADAs) and DAO personnel.</p>
The DAO DATA Lab was created by District Attorney Krasner to help the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office and the criminal legal system end the era of mass incarceration and mass supervision, and to ensure transparency and accountability while doing so. During a time of rapid change in the criminal legal system, the DATA Lab supports research that aligns with the following principles:

<em>The DAO has partnered with researchers to implement a series of Prosecutorial Performance Indicators (PPIs) that measure office performance, specifically related to disparities and fairness in the criminal justice system. The researchers will also collect data through interviews, focus groups, and/or surveys to further contextualize the PPIs. The PPIs will then be used within the DAO to advance prosecutorial effectiveness and fairness through data and innovation to improve the legal system.</em><br><br> <em>$100k over 2 years</em>

<div class="accordion-description">
<p>
<p>Florida International University and Loyola University Chicago are implementing a two-year project with six prosecutor’s offices across the country, including the Philadelphia DAO. Most prosecutor’s offices lack the resources to systematically and objectively measure their performance. This project stems from a growing recognition that prosecutors need to become more data-driven and evidence-based, and each partner office is interested in developing greater data collection and analytical capacity to run their offices more effectively and fairly. The backdrop for this project is the Safety and Justice Challenge, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation initiative to reduce jail misuse and overuse as both a crucial component and a major driver of America’s over-reliance on incarceration. Unnecessary jail incarceration carries significant costs to individuals, families, communities, and society at large. These costs take their greatest toll on low-income people and communities of color.</p>
The PPI project has a goal to advance both social science and prosecutorial practice. Prosecutorial practice is advanced through the following four objectives:
<ol type="1">
<li>
Improve data and analytical capacity
</li>
<li>
Develop and implement new performance indicators to assess progress over time
</li>
<li>
Respond to the need to ameliorate racial and ethnic disparities in the justice system
</li>
<li>
Communicate more effectively within and outside the prosecutor’s office
</li>
</ol>

<em>An assessment documenting reductions in community supervision lengths under two DAO policies. Racial disparities in sentencing decreased and the reforms were implemented without increases in re-charge rates.</em>
</p>

<div class="accordion-description">
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Probation and parole – commonly called community supervision – can be less restrictive alternatives to incarceration, but overly lengthy supervision terms are harmful to the defendant and to public safety. Community supervision rates in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia are particularly high: at the beginning of District Attorney Krasner’s term, 1 in 23 adults in Philadelphia was on community supervision. This evaluation documents two policies to end mass supervision that were implemented in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office. Under the policies, median supervision lengths decreased by 12 months (a 25% reduction) for felony negotiated guilty pleas and 3 months (a 33% reduction) for misdemeanor negotiated pleas. Prior to the policy changes, white defendants received supervision sentences that were almost 11 months shorter than Black defendants’, on average. The policy reduced the disparity to 5.2 months, a more-than-50% reduction. The policies were implemented without an increase in recidivism: there was no measurable change in re-charge rates between people sentenced under the policies and those sentenced beforehand. The DAO has made progress, but collaboration by all system actors and lawmakers across the Commonwealth is necessary to end mass supervision in Pennsylvania.

<em>A DAO evaluation of bail reform implemented by the DAO in 2018 showing that the policy reduced the use of cash bail without impacting recidivism or court appearance rates. The wide-ranging policy applied to over three in five charges, allowing approximately 1,750 additional Philadelphians to be released without cash bail in 2018, and was implemented at no cost. (See Ouss and Stevenson in Published Studies for more).</em>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> The use of cash bail and pretrial detention disproportionately impacts people living in poverty and people of color, influencing the trajectory of legal cases, and is a driver of mass incarceration. Fifty days into DA Krasner’s administration, the Philadelphia DAO implemented a new policy targeting 25 charges where an analysis of historical data showed the courts had been setting bail very low—requiring payment of less than $1,000. For these specific charges, a presumption was created to not request cash bail. As a result, the release on recognizance rate for eligible charges increased from 83% pre-policy to 90% post-policy for misdemeanors, and from 24% pre-policy to 32% post-policy for felonies. We observed a continued upward trend in the likelihood that someone would fail to appear in court at least once, but no increase in pre-trial re-arrest rates for either misdemeanors or felonies targeted by the bail policy. Overall the policy and evaluation demonstrate that more people can safely be released during the pretrial period, offering broad social benefits to individuals and communities while reducing unnecessary burdens on the criminal legal system.

<strong>Abstract:</strong>Our sworn oath as prosecutors is to seek justice unconditionally, with no limit as to time. When we discover past injustices, we must not only right those wrongs, but implement policies to ensure that they do not occur again in the future. This report describes how an independent Conviction Integrity Unit, with a broad mandate, has worked to change the culture and practices of the District Attorney’s Office. Our oath requires that we never stop trying to fix injustices, even if they turn out to be the product of our administration’s missteps. During court proceedings involving defendants the CIU has determined to be innocent of the crimes for which they were wrongly convicted, the District Attorney’s Office as an institution has apologized to the exonerees. We should. Lost years and decades of a life cannot be returned. But we remain enormously proud of what we have done to date.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study we examined the Philadelphia District Attorney Office’s approach to juvenile lifer resentencing, which began in 2017 under the administration of District Attorney Williams and has continued under the administration of District Attorney Krasner. For 174 cases resentenced as of December 31st, 2019, we describe similarities and differences between the Williams and Krasner administrations in decision making and sentence length reductions, and report on the recidivism rate and estimated cost savings for Pennsylvania as a result of release. Philadelphia’s experience also shows that when this review process leads to release, successful reintegration is not just possible, but is the most likely outcome (as evidenced by negligible recidivism rates, 1.14% reconviction rate). These releases also come with substantial cost savings, an estimated $9.5M in correctional costs for Pennsylvania over the first decade, just for the 174 juvenile lifers released. Considering that the overwhelming majority of individuals who commit crime—even serious crime—“age out” of criminal behavior, the societal, financial, and public safety benefits of continued incarceration of those serving lengthy sentences is called into question by the Philadelphia experience.

<em>An evaluation showing that 2018 bail reform led by the DAO successfully increased the number of people released without having to pay cash bail while not increasing pretrial misconduct or decreasing court appearance rates.</em>
</p>

<div class="accordion-description">
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Dozens of jurisdictions across the country are engaging in bail reform, but there are concerns that reducing monetary incentives will increase pretrial misconduct. We provide new evidence on this question by evaluating a prosecutor-led bail reform in Philadelphia. In February 2018, Philadelphia’s district attorney announced that his oﬃce would no longer request monetary bail for defendants charged with certain eligible oﬀenses. This was an advisory change; bail magistrates retained ﬁnal say. Using a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences approach we ﬁnd that this policy led to a 22% increase in the likelihood a defendant will be released with no monetary or supervisory conditions, but had no impact on pretrial detention. This provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the primary justiﬁcation for cash bail: that it provides incentive for released defendants to appear in court. We ﬁnd no evidence that cash bail or pretrial supervision has a deterrent eﬀect on failure-to-appear or pretrial crime. We argue that one explanation is that asymmetric reputational penalties cause magistrates to set bail higher than necessary. In addition, our study provides evidence on the role of discretion within criminal justice reform. We ﬁnd that discretion led to racial disparities in implementation, and diluted the impacts of the reform.

<em>This study describes how often people who fatally overdosed in Philadelphia in 2016 interacted with the criminal legal system throughout their life, including how their criminal history may have made them ineligible for diversion programs.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many studies document high risk of fatal overdose after incarceration. Few explore earlier touchpoints in criminal justice processes, like arrests and court hearings. Understanding these touchpoints is important for several reasons. Arrest and adjudicatory processes are harmful even when not resulting in incarceration. Arrests and criminal hearings also may reflect changes in overdose-related risk factors like transitions in employment and housing stability. Moreover, knowledge about these touchpoints contextualizes debate about the implementation of court-based programs like Drug Treatment Courts. This study described the incidence and accumulation of touchpoints for people who fatally overdosed in Philadelphia in 2016, and depicted how touchpoint incidence and characteristics interface with court-program eligibility.</p>
<p>In 2016, 907 people fatally overdosed in Philadelphia. Of these, 605 had at least one or more of 3,926 arrests and 3,822 hearings over their lifetime. There were 488 arrests and 533 hearings in the two years before death, with public disorder charges especially common closer to death. Less than 20% of these hearings resulted in custodial sentences. Of individuals with touchpoints, only nine participated in Drug Treatment Court, consistent with findings that most individuals were ineligible. Latent class analysis suggested five distinguishable patterns in age, timing, and characteristics of touchpoints.</p>
The type and frequency of touchpoints preceding fatal overdose reflect a period of complex vulnerability. Few individuals qualified for court-based programming, underscoring the limitations of supporting this population in specialized court settings. Reducing incidence and improving the health impact of criminal justice touchpoints remain important public health priorities.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> New technological advances are rapidly impacting the type of evidence available in criminal cases. This includes advances in DNA technology, fingerprint detection, and the existence and usage of body-worn camera (BWC) footage, amongst others. This study is broadly interested in understanding whether the use and interpretation of such technologically-aided evidence impacts prosecutorial decisions, conviction, and sentencing outcomes, and how these impacts differ across groups.

Minor charges with major impacts: Understanding the use of select misdemeanors among persons with serious mental illnesses

<div class="accordion-description">
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Approximately one million arrests per year in the United States involve persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI), and such individuals are over-represented across all facets of the criminal justice system. Research to date has shown that it is misdemeanor charges that are often used to address behaviors associated with manifestations of illness (e.g., a person with disorganized thinking and disorganized behavior stemming from schizophrenia could be charged with disorderly conduct or another public nuisance misdemeanor), or stem from the circumstances in which persons with SMI find themselves (e.g., a person with limited financial resources and homelessness could be charged with criminal trespass, loitering, panhandling, or other misdemeanor charges). However, remarkably little research has been done to describe and explain the exact nature of the applied misdemeanor charges. This includes the underlying logic(s) for applying such charges in the face of limited alternatives, as well as how such charges move through different stages of criminal justice decision-making, beginning with officers on the street. By deepening our knowledge of the nature, use and processing of select misdemeanor charges, the findings of this study should inform current research and policy efforts in Philadelphia and elsewhere centered on alternative approaches to the handling of mental health-related incidents. This study has a 4-site comparative focus – Atlanta, Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago.

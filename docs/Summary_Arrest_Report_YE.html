Summary offenses are the lowest level of criminal offense in Pennslyvania, often refered to as ‘non-traffic citations.’ Unlike Misdemeanors and Felonies, the police in Philadelphia can arrest and charge a person for a summary offense without the intervention of the District Attorney’s Office.</p>

Among other changes, overall arrests and cases charged have been lower than prior years and those arrests that have happened tend to be for more serious offenses.
